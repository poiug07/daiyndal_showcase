# daiyndal_showcase

Daiyndal is LMS platform with courses focused on preparation of 6th grade students in Kazakhstan to pass entrance exams to Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools.

This is a showcase version of Daiyndal website. I will try to keep this repository up to date, but the original production code is hidden for obvious reasons. You can try visiting [daiyndal.kz](https://daiyndal.kz), if it is not running then it is probably under maintenance or shut down for other reasons.

This repo is forced to run on local machine, but I included Nginx and Gunicorn setting files in repo.
